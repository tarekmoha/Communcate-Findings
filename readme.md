## Summary of Analysis process:

During the Analysis I have found that the data is divided into 2 main categories according to the timing of the loan itself, before and after 2009 and this unfortunately afftected the quality of the data which whe have to make different loan grading and this affecs on the other variables too.

the data before 2009 is less accurate and have a lot of quality issues and missing data, the the whole dataset was suffering from some issues like wrong data types for variables, and some weird entries about some loans.

I also changed the values for sum columns to make it more appropriate representation of these variables.

there was also a naming or qaulity issues I have found like reprentaion of the same information one in alpha and the other in numeric so I chose what I see appropriate for it.

## Insights and finding:

    1. the data mainly can be divided into 2 main categories according to the timeing of loans, before and after 2009 and there was a lot of differences in collected variables.
    2. When Someone is asking for a loan we have to be ore accurate bout their amplyment status and his income, the data was full of confusing information so we have to be more carefull in collecting the right data.
    3. the main findings that we had is that:
        The Feasts like Chrismas ha an incrdible effect in the number of loans.
        We have to faciliate the loans to some states and expand our services there.
        there is a strong relationship between Income Range for the borrower and all other variables like Debt to income ratio and Number of open credit lines.
